```java
// Initiate an outgoing voice or video call
Address to = Address.parse("usr:john");
callClient.startCall(to, isVideo);
```

After the call has been initiated with `startCall()` method, the SDK will broadcast `your.package.name.BIT6_CALL_ADDED` intent to notify the application UI about a new ongoing call.
