Bit6 interconnects with the phone networks (PSTN) and allows making outgoing phone calls.

Phone numbers must be in [E164](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format, prefixed with `+`. So a US (country code `1`) number `(555) 123-1234` must be presented as `+15551231234`.

Note, that for the demo purposes you can only make 1 minute free phone calls to the US and Canada numbers.

```java
// Initiate an outgoing phone call
callClient.startPhoneCall("+15551231234");
```

After the call has been initiated, the application will be notified about a new call in progress via the same intent mechanism described in the previous section.
