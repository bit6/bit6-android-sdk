Bit6 is a real-time, cloud-based communications-as-a-service platform that allows
mobile and web application developers to quickly and easily add voice/video calling,

In addition Bit6 provides a suite of essential services including Identity Management, 
Social Map, and Virtual Wallet to help integrate the communication capabilities into a complete end-user experience.
