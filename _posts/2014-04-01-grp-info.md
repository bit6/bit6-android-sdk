A `Group` contains a set of properties (group id, meta information, permissions) and has members.
A user can be a member of multiple groups.

### Get Groups

Get all groups that this user is a member of

```java
Cursor cursor = getContentResolver().query(Contract.Groups.CONTENT_URI,null, null, null, null);
```

### Create a Group

Create a new group. The current user will become the group administrator.

```java
// groupId, permissions and meta are optional and can be null
bit6.createGroup(groupId, permissions, meta, handler);
```

### Update a Group
```java
updateGroup(groupId, permissions, meta, handler);
```

### Delete a Group

```java
bit6.deleteGroup(groupId, handler);
```
